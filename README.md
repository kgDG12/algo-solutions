## Algorithm Solutions

This repository contains the solutions to the algorithms in the freecodecamp.org
[Coding Interviews Prep](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/algorithms/).

## Algorithms

This repository contains the solutions to the following algorithms:

- [Bubble Sort](/src/implement-bubble-sort.js)
- [Selection Sort](/src/implement-selection-sort.js)
- [Insertion Sort](/src/implement-insertion-sort.js)
- [Find Symmetric Difference](/src/find-the-symmetric-difference.js)
- [Repeated Permutations](/src/no-repeats-please.js)
- [Sum of Pairwise Indexes](/src/pairwise.js)

Under Progress:

- [Inventory Update](/src/inventory-update.js)

> Inventory Update's logic is working but it's not implemented with [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

## Running the Algorithms

```bash
npm run start
```

This will give you prompts to run the specific algorithm file.

> Perform `npm install` to install the dependencies.

### Notes

The solutions are written in **Javascript**.

Running the solutions in the browser is not supported.

Use the solutions in the terminal. I have used [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to ask questions to the user. but you can use any other library to ask questions to the user.

> This is just for the sake of learning. I guess you might already knew that.
